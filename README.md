🎯 **About Me**

I'm a data-driven professional with a Master’s in IT and over 6 years of experience across data engineering, analytics, and applied data science. I specialize in building scalable ETL pipelines, designing dimensional data models, and delivering analytics solutions that drive business outcomes. I have a passion for simplifying complex data systems into actionable insights and empowering stakeholders through well-architected data platforms and self-serve tools.

My expertise spans the end-to-end data lifecycle, with a focus on:

- **Designing scalable data pipelines** using Airflow, dbt, and cloud-native tools
- **Modeling dimensional data structures** to support analytics and self-serve reporting
- **Engineering robust data platforms** with Snowflake, BigQuery, and Iceberg on GCP/AWS
- **Writing production-grade code** in Python and SQL for data transformation, automation, and validation
- **Applying machine learning** to real-world problems using TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn

📍 Based in Bay Area, California | 🌐 Working across cloud & hybrid data ecosystems
